## Light simulation
- the kitchen scene

- importance to calculate the light
  + all light sources
  + the reflection of others objects
  + light from other side (like through a glass)

- based on physics
- not based in physics

- local and non-local light
  + __local__ considers the light only on the given point, ignores the rest of the world (except the light source) __O(n)__
    * shadows have to be calculated separately
    * takes only direct lighting information
    * involves the use of an "ambient" term to simulate indirect lighting

  + __global__ much more complex, but also includes the shadows __O(n^n)__
    * direct illumination: object that receive light without another object blocking it
    * objects in the shadow can still receive light from light rays bouncing off others objects (indirect illumination)

- figures (one of them has an error)
  + the local model shouldn't have a shadow on the foot of the objects, they are directly exposed to the light source

### Local Illumination (Phong)
- reduce light model to 3 components
  + ambient
  + diffuse
  + specular

- we will have a equation that give the exact light at a given point
- later we shall see how to use this equation __without infinite points__ (shading)

- even knowing that we calculate the light for just a point we need to simplify it and dis considers some things

- to make the calculation we need the light source info and the material reflection behavior

#### Ambient light contribution
- ambient light = background light
  + it's used to simulate indirect lighting

- irl the light stop reflecting once there is no more wave to be propagated
  + in CG we stop calculating once it gets to hard for the computer :p

- since we cannot calculate the real l

- ambient component
  + independent of
    * object's position
    * viewer's position
    * light source's position

  + dependent of
    * a constant factor (in each RGB channels)

#### Diffuse light contribution
- depends on the light's position and the surface property of reflection

- but it is independent of the viewer's position

- solution if based on __Lambert's Law__
  + diffuse = K * I * cos(@)
    * K: material's reflection property
    * I: light intensity
    * @: angle between the point normal vector and light vector

#### Diffuse + Ambient
- we basically sum the diffuse light with the remains of the light of the ambient

#### Specular light contribution
- light reflection from shinny surfaces
  + e.g. metal

- it highly depends of the viewer's position

- the vector with most specular light is exact reflection of the light vector

- specular = K * I * cos(@)^f
  + K: specular reflection constant
  + I: light intensity
  + @: angle between light vector and reflection vector
  + f: specular variation
